# DMFamiliar
Collection of simple tools for tabletop roleplaying games.

Contains two tools:

## Choreograph
Features
 - Easily roll battle initiative and track turn order for all involved characters
 - Quickly add a character by inputing a name and initiative modifier! Optionally set and lock its initiative for direct control.
 - Effortlessly select which characters are involved each combat. A list of previously used characters is at your disposal!
 - Display a widget showing turn order; this display stays on top of all windows, so manipulate your tokens on Roll20 with initiative only an eye-swivel away!
 - [Synonym for easily] progress turn order by clicking on the display widget or by pressing CTRL + Space.
 

## Roll The Dice
Features
 - Setup rules for repetitive dice rolls, from Bandit melee attacks to a full Wild Magic Surge chart. Very flexible.
 - Click a rule's button and see the result!
 - Create different "Profiles" for different groups of rules; give the Brown Bear 'Bite' and 'Claw', give the Lich its full spell list!
 - Colour included!
